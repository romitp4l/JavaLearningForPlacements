      /*  Here is an example of how insertion sort would sort the array [5, 2, 4, 7, 1]:

        The first element (5) is already sorted, so we move on to the next element (2).
        2 is smaller than 5, so we insert it into the array before 5. This gives us the array [2, 5, 4, 7, 1].
        The next element (4) is greater than 2, so we don't need to insert it anywhere.
        The next element (7) is greater than 2 and 5, so we don't need to insert it anywhere.
        The last element (1) is smaller than 2, so we insert it into the array before 2. This gives us the sorted array [1, 2, 4, 5, 7].
        Here is the Java code for insertion sort:
